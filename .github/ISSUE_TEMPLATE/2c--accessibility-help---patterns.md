### Help Us Out

Adding a scaffolding of the behavior in a feature branch that we can then make accessible will save us time AND make us more likely to prioritize your issue!

### NOTE

Responses to these may take time. When we set out to implement such a control we don't just say: eh... try this API. We set out to make a beautifully accessible experience for customers. This includes putting our finished product in front of users with disabilities BEFORE the implementation makes its way into the master branch. If we accept one of these issues expect to see design ideas, concept art, and a beta before the issue is "Closed".
