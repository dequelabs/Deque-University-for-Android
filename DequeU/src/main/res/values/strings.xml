    <!-- About Tab Strings-->
    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_intro">In the Android Accessibility world there are multiple ways of providing alternate text for a view. The <i>content description</i> attribute is the most basic. It attaches a description to a view, <i>ImageView</i>, or other focusable object, that otherwise has no string content. When writing <i>content descriptions</i>, be sure to consider the basic ARIA name, role, state, and value. Remember that TalkBack and the Android framework attempt to figure some of this out for you based on the type of object you are using. That being said, it is important to test your application with TalkBack to ensure everything is announced properly.</string>

    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_heading_5">How to Fix It</string>
    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_paragraph_1_null">This image has a null <i>content description</i>. As a result, the user can\'t focus on it using <i>TalkBack</i>; this makes it impossible for the user to obtain information about the image.</string>
    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_paragraph_2_empty">This image has a blank string as a <i>content description</i>. Such a description allows the user to focus on the image using <i>TalkBack</i>, but the description is a default image number and the information that the image is \"unlabeled,\" which is entirely unhelpful. An empty <i>content description</i> occurs when it is hardcoded in xml as a blank string, which is a string made up of whitespace characters. If it is hardcoded as an empty string or assigned as an empty or lank string in a separate strings.xml file, the <i>ImageView</i> behaves as if it had a null <i>content description</i></string>
    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_paragraph_3_when_to_use"><i>Content descriptions</i> should be used in order to provide information desribing a focusable object, such as an <i>ImageView</i>. <i>Content descriptions</i> should not be used for background images, decorative borders, or other things that are not pertinent to the information being conveyed through your app or website.</string>
    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_paragraph_4_duplicated_info">This image\'s <i>content description</i> exactly duplicates the visual label and thus provides no new information to a TalkBack user.</string>
    <string name="aac_cont_desc_about_paragraph_5_fix_it">Fixing this accessibility issue is simple. All you need to do is add a <i>content description</i> to objects that display pertinent information or perform a function such as non-decorative ImageViews, Switches, Buttons, other views, etc. These <i>content descriptions</i> should be concise, but as descriptive as possible in order to provide a TalkBack user with the information necessary to interpret the object. The first two issues, null and empty <i>content descriptions</i>, can be fixed in this way. To fix the third issue, duplicated information, be sure to think about the best combination of <i>content description</i> and visual label so as not to be redundant, but still provide necessary information for a TalkBack user. </string>
