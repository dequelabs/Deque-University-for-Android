# Deque-University-for-Android

Welcome to the git repository for Deque University for Android! If you are looking for the iOS version, we also have [Deque University for iOS](https://github.com/dequelabs/Deque-University-for-iOS)

This app is a set of interactive demos and informational stories that demonstrate best practices when coding for both usability and accessibility.

### We are currently using:

Android 4.2 or later

Android Studio 1.3 or later

Java SDK 1.8.0_45

##Demo List

<ul>
<li>TalkBack</li>
<li>Control Labels</li>
<li>Content Descriptions</li>
<li>EditTexts</li>
<li>Tabbed Navigation</li>
<li>Acronym Announcement</li>
</ul>

The app also has a TalkBack simulation so that sighted users can see for themselves how an accessibility failure affects TalkBack users. Click the eye icon in the upper right hand corner of any story to put an overlay on the screen that forces you to rely on TalkBack to navigate the screen.
