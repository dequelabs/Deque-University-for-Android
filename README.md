As a Service that runs alongside your Application.
As an Automated UI Testing Framework
To Enhanced a Third Party UI Testing Library (like Calabash) to add an Accessibility Testing Step.
Attest for Android is very flexible and is built to fit into a multitude of workflows. Each example in Deque University has rules in Attest that will help you debug and build the most Accessible behaviors.
